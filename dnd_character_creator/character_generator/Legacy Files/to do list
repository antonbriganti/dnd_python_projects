write output to file
create "optimised" full char gen
    generate scores as usual, sort in ascending order
    determine best AS build per subclass
    push ascending order into those asi

    i.e. Barbarian is STR CON DEX WIS CHA INT, so push sorted AS on like that
    maybe intialise all AS as zero, roll for a tmp score, sort it, then use list indexes and add

    Barbarian_build is [0,2,1,4,5,3], barbarian_roll is [15, 14, 12, 9, 9, 9], barbarian_as is [0,0,0,0,0,0]
    for i in build
        as[build[i]] += roll[i]

    output should be [15, 12, 14, 9, 9, 9]
