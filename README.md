## Character Generator
Currently uses JSON files as input for class and race information.
Can be run through a standalone script or through the AWS driver script, which is used for lambda execution.

Generates a random weapon, can be either magical or non-magical.
Currently only supports melee weapons, reads ability and weapon information in from JSON files.
Magical properties adapted from [Len Pelletier's table of magical properties.](http://lordbyng.net/inspiration/tables.php)
